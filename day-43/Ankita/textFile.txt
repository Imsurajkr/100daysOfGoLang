Techopedia explains Text File
A text file is used to store standard and structured textual data or information 
that is human readable. It is defined in several different formats, including the
 most popular ASCII for cross-platform usage, and ANSI for Windows-based operating
  platforms. It lacks text formatting abilities, such as text alignment, bold text and font styles.

In a Windows operating system (OS), a text file is created using a text editor, 
such as Notepad or Word. It has a file extension of .txt.

Besides simply text, a text file is used to write and store source code for 
virtually all programming languages, such as Java or PHP. The created file can 
be converted to the respective programming language by changing the file 
extension from .txt to .php or .cpp.
